game notes:
i have completed coding this game as the web specified(although with minor errors) and i have also added some bonus features to my game:
1. i have limited the number of times that a player can shoot (only 4 times, out of arrows = game ends)
2. i have added a lucky god character in the game that can tell you where the wumpus is, but u have to meet him in the room
3. the game will not give you any hints at first round
4. the wumpus will move if you step on a bat room and at the same time one of the bat room will relocate as well
5. as the original page suggested, feeling a cold blow of wind means a pit or pits nearby and smell something terrible means bats or wumpus nearby. those two hints can coexist
6. there are only three ways to end the game, killed by wumpus, killed by pit or player kills the wumpus
 
other notes:
1. this game will require people to install ruby gem first in order to run and i have coded this game in visual studio code
